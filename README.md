# React Interview Question

**Q1. High Order Component ?**

A1. High order component is a design pattern that allow you to reuse the component logic and it share with multiple component, As you know High Order function take the 
component as arrgument and return the new component with accept new props and functionality with the help of this you make your project more moduler and reuse.

**Q2. React HOOKS ?**

A2. React HOOKS is introduced in react 16.8 version that's make more powerfull and versatile.

  **(i) useState** - allows to functional compoenet to manage the local state.
    
    EX- const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  
  **(ii) useEffect** - It's handle the react lift cycle mathod Mount, update and unmount
    
    Ex-  useEffect(()=>{
      Arrgument
    },[Dependency]);
  
  **(iii) useContext** - It's access the context of parent component, it's used to consume values provided by a 'Context.Provider' component.
  
  **(iv) useReducer** - It's is used for complex state management scenerio like redux, it's take a reducer function and intial state and return the current stateand a displatch a function.

  **(v) useRef** - It's is used for direct manipulation in DOM cause that have direct access of DOM.

  **(vi) useMemo** - Hook in React is used to optimize performance by memoizing the result of a computation and preventing unnecessary recalculations of that result during re-renders.

**Q3. VDOM in REACT ?**

A3. The Virtual DOM (VDOM) is a concept in React that serves as an abstraction layer between the actual DOM (Document Object Model) and the components in a React application. It is a critical part of what makes React highly efficient and helps optimize the performance of web applications. Here's the best way to explain the VDOM:

**Understanding the DOM:**

The DOM is a programming interface for web documents. It represents the structure of a web page, where each element (like a heading, paragraph, or image) is a node in the tree-like structure.

When you make changes to the DOM, such as adding, updating, or removing elements, it can be an expensive operation in terms of performance because it may trigger a reflow and repaint of the web page, which can be slow.

**The Problem with Direct DOM Manipulation:**

In traditional JavaScript, if you want to update a part of a web page, you directly manipulate the DOM using methods like getElementById, appendChild, innerHTML, etc.

When you manipulate the DOM directly, it can be slow and inefficient because each manipulation can trigger immediate changes to the actual web page, causing performance bottlenecks, especially in complex applications.

**Introducing the Virtual DOM:**

React addresses this problem by introducing the concept of the Virtual DOM.

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the actual DOM. It's essentially a JavaScript object that mirrors the structure of the real DOM.

When you render a React component, it doesn't directly update the actual DOM. Instead, it creates a Virtual DOM representation of the component's output.

**The Reconciliation Process:**

When you make changes to your React component's state or props, React creates a new Virtual DOM representation of the component.

React then compares this new Virtual DOM with the previous one using a process called "reconciliation" (or "diffing").

During reconciliation, React identifies the differences between the new and old Virtual DOMs (i.e., which parts of the UI need to be updated).

**Updating the Actual DOM:**

Once React knows which parts of the Virtual DOM need to be updated, it updates the actual DOM in the most efficient way possible.

Instead of making individual, direct changes to the DOM for each update, React batches multiple changes together and updates the DOM in a single pass. This reduces the number of expensive DOM manipulations and repaints.

**Benefits of the Virtual DOM:**

Performance Optimization: By minimizing direct DOM manipulation and batching updates, React reduces the time it takes to update the UI and increases application performance.

Cross-Browser Compatibility: The Virtual DOM allows React to handle browser-specific quirks and inconsistencies, providing a consistent development experience.

Easier Development: Developers can work with a declarative, component-based approach, focusing on describing what the UI should look like rather than worrying about low-level DOM operations.

In summary, the Virtual DOM is a key feature of React that improves performance by minimizing direct DOM manipulation, reducing the number of updates to the actual DOM, and enabling efficient updates through a process of reconciliation. It's a critical part of what makes React a highly efficient and developer-friendly library for building user interfaces.
